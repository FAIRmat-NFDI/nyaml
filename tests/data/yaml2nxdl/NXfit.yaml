        doc: |
          The ``input_dependent`` field must have the same rank (``dimRank``)
          as the ``input_independent`` field. Each individual dimension of ``input_dependent``
          must have the same number of points as the corresponding dimension in
          the ``input_independent`` field.

        Independent input axis for this fit procedure.
      dimensions:

        doc: |
          The ``input_independent`` field must have the same rank (``dimRank``)
          as the ``input_dependent`` field. Each individual dimension of ``input_independent``

        doc: |
          The ``envelope`` field must have the same rank (``dimRank``)

        Difference between the envelope and the `input_independent` data to be fitted.
      dimensions:
        rank: dimRank
        doc: |
          The ``residual`` field must have the same rank (``dimRank``)
          as the ``input_independent`` field. Each individual dimension of ``residual``
          must have the same number of points as the corresponding dimension in
          the ``input_independent`` field.
  peakPEAK(NXpeak):
    doc: |
      One peak of the peak model.
      If there is no characteristic name for each peak component, is envisioned that peaks
      are labeled as peak_0, peak_1, and so on.
    total_area(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        Total area under the curve (can also be used for the total area minus any
        background values).
    relative_sensitivity_factor(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_UNITLESS
      doc: |
        Relative sensitivity for this peak, to be used for quantification in
        an NXprocess.
        
        As an example, in X-ray spectroscopy could depend on the energy scale
        (see position), the ionization cross section, and the element probed.
    relative_area(NX_NUMBER):
      unit: NX_ANY
      doc: |
        Relative area of this peak compared to other peaks.
        
        The relative area can simply be derived by dividing the total_area by the
        total area of all peaks or by a more complicated method (e.g., by
        additionally dividing by the relative sensitivity factors). Details shall
        be given in `global_fit_function`.
  backgroundBACKGROUND(NXfit_background):
    doc: |
      One fitted background (functional form, position, and intensities) of the peak fit.
      If there is no characteristic name for each peak component, it is envisioned that backgrounds are labeled
      as background_0, background_1, and so on.
  global_fit_function(NXfit_function):
    doc: |
      Function used to describe the overall fit to the data, taking into account the parameters of the
      individual `NXpeak` and `NXfit_background` components.
    formula:
      doc: |
        Oftentimes, if the peaks and fit backgrounds are defined independently (i.e, with their own
        parameter sets), the resulting global fit is a function of the form
        :math:`model = peak_1(p_1) + peak2(p_2) + backgr(p_3).`, where each :math:`p_x` describes the
        set of parameters for one peak/background.
  error_function(NXfit_function):
    doc: |
      Function used to optimize the parameters during peak fitting.
    description:
      doc: |
        Description of the method used to optimize the parameters during peak fitting.
        Examples:
        - least squares
        - non-linear least squares
        - Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (damped least-squares)
        - linear regression
        - Bayesian linear regression
    formula:
      doc: |
        For the optimization, the formula is any optimization process on the `global_fit_function` given above.
        As an example, for a linear least squared algorithm on independent components, the formula of the error_function
        would be :math:`LLS(peak_1(p_1) + peak2(p_2) + backgr(p_3))`, where each :math:`p_x` describes the set
        of parameters for one peak/background.
        
        It is however also possible to supply more involved formulas (e.g., in the case of constrained fits).
  figure_of_meritMETRIC(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    doc: |
      Figure-of-merit to determine the goodness of fit, i.e., how well the peak model
      fits the measured observations.
      
      This value (which is a single number) is oftenused to guide adjustments to the
      fitting parameters in the peak fitting process.
    \@metric:
      doc: |
        Metric used to determine the goodness of fit. Examples include:
        - :math:`\chi^2`, the squared sum of the sigma-weighted residuals
        - reduced :math:`\chi^2`:, :math:`\chi^2`: per degree of freedom
        - :math:`R^2`, the coefficient of determination
