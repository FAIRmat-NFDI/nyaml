        Most compact way to write simple dimensions definitions as fast as possible.
        Rank is set automatically as the length of the dim definition:
        Examples are (1, symbol_a, symbol_b) will get rank 3, (3,) will get rank 1.
      dim: (1, symbol_a, symbol_b,)

        A compact way to define dimensionsType using numpy style notation.

    shorthand_explicit_rank_new(NX_NUMBER):
      doc: |
        Shorthand where the rank can be set explicitly. For testing purposes
        the rank is here intentionally set to a value that is different to the number
        of entries in dim.
        
        Authors and designers of NeXus classes should preferentially use
        the shorthand notation unless the full_syntax is required as
        using rank_only is insufficient.
        
        This is the default to which nxdl2yaml converts unless
        the XML content substantiates that either using
        rank_only suffices or that full_syntax is required.
      dimensions:
        rank: 2
        dim: (1, symbol_a, symbol_b)
    shorthand_explicit_rank_old(NX_NUMBER):
      doc: |
        A version of shorthand_explicit_rank_new that supports
        legacy formatting (double edge brackets) still left before
        the yaml and nxdl files where reprocessed while integrating
        changes of the NIAC Autumn 2024 meeting done Febr, 2025.

        The full syntax that is the only way to use old deprecated elements
        of the dimensionsType attributes.
