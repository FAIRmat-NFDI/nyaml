  * Each :ref:`NXdata` group will define one field as the default
    plottable data.  The value of the ``signal`` attribute names this field.
    Additional fields may be used to describe the dimension scales and
    uncertainities.
    The ``auxiliary_signals`` attribute is a list of the other fields
    to be plotted with the ``signal`` data.
  * The plottable data may be of arbitrary rank up to a maximum
    of ``NX_MAXRANK=32`` (for compatibility with backend file formats).
  * The plottable data will be named as the value of
    the group ``signal`` attribute, such as::

      data:NXdata
        @signal = "counts"
        @axes = "mr"
        @mr_indices = 0
        counts: float[100]  --> the default dependent data
        mr: float[100]  --> the default independent data

    The field named in the ``signal`` attribute **must** exist, either
    directly as a NeXus field or defined through a link.
